<h2>Deep Learning</h2>
<p>
A convolutional neural network (CNN or ConvNet), is a network architecture for deep learning which learns directly from data, eliminating the need for manual feature extraction.

CNNs are particularly useful for finding patterns in images to recognize objects, faces, and scenes. They can also be quite effective for classifying non-image data such as audio, time series, and signal data.

Applications that call for object recognition and computer vision — such as self-driving vehicles and face-recognition applications — rely heavily on CNNs.</p>

<h2>Accuracy</h2>
<p>We have choosen Batch size of 32. Total 5 different vegetables classes are made included <b><i>Potato</i></b>, <b><i>Tomato</i></b>, <b><i>Onion</i></b>, <b><i>Carrot</i></b> , <b><i>Cucumber</i></b>.</p> <hr>
<p>The accuracy we get is 96.44% after 30 epochs trained , it could be maximized later</p>
